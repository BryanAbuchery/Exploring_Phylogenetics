# Exploring_Phylogenetics

Phosphoinositol Pyrophosphates play a crucial role in many cellular functions such as DNA repair, Apoptosis, Celullar Autophagy and Ageing. Model eukaryotes have demostrated the importance of various PP-IPs and can possibly inform new targets of drug development. One of these organisms are Trypanosomatids, which are important agents of Trypanosomiasis, Leishmaniasis and Chagas Disease all over the world. 

## Inositol Hexakisphosphates in Tryapanosomatids

Eukaryotes and indeed Trypanosomatids have developed complex signaling pathways to adapt to a readily changing environment, including the phosphoinositol pyrophosphates (InsPs) signaling pathway.  In plants and humans the pyrophosphorylated inositol molecules, inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs), have been implicated in phosphate and energy sensing.  PP-InsPs are synthesized from the phosphorylationof InsP6 (Inositol hexakisphosphate), the most abundant InsP. The plant PP-InsP synthesis pathway is similar but distinct from that of the human, which may reflect differences in how molecules such as Ins(1,4,5)P3 and InsP6function in plants vs.  animals. These differences could translate to other organisms such as fungi and protozoans. In addition, PP-InsPs can potentially interact with several majorsignaling proteins, suggesting PP-InsPs play unique signaling roles via binding to protein partners.

This project explores the phylogenetics of Phosphoinositol Hexakisphosphosphates in Trypanosomatids compared to other model eukaryotes. After which, evolution of PP-IPs in these organisms can be established from whence a prediction model of the structure of PP-IPs in Trypanosomatids can be established. This exploration will establish the similarities and dissimilarities of Inositol hexakisphosphates between Trypanosomatids and other organisms.
